### Platform for Managing Feature Flags

**Ship Code Safely**. Mitigate risks with Production Testing, roll out new features to 1% of users initially then expanding, and ensure instant error recovery without redeployment.

**Innovate Faster**. Decouple feature deployment from release to minimize merge conflicts. Deploy at will, and release any feature immediately upon request from the boss.

**Born for developers**. Use simple if/else statements to control and release features, eliminating complex DevOps tasks. This enables developers to directly drive business value. FeatBit refine tool details, freeing up your energy to better focus on the business.
